## Hi there 👋

I’m Yusuf Dirdis, a Computer Science student at Florida International University (FIU) with a passion for building AI-powered, real-world software applications. I focus on creating practical systems that combine artificial intelligence, full-stack development, and thoughtful system design to solve meaningful problems.

🤖 Projects & Technical Focus
I actively design and build applications that integrate AI models, modern web technologies, and scalable backends, including:

AI-powered planning and recommendation systems, using tools like Google Gemini, function calling, and external APIs.

Agent-based and data-driven applications, including real-time monitoring systems with automated alerts and natural-language interfaces.

Interactive and immersive web experiences, leveraging Three.js, WebGL, and modern JavaScript frameworks to improve usability and engagement.

Full-stack development, using Python (Flask/FastAPI), Node.js, SQL/SQLite, and cloud platforms to deliver end-to-end solutions.

🧠 Interests
